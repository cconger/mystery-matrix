Mystery Matrix

Host both index.html and player.html.

Have the board visible on a shared screen and each player goes to player.

Click the squares when you get it right, click your cards when you get it wrong.

###Known issues: 

players might have the same card (and by virtue players get a second chance at the same square).  I'm not
doing any syncing.

Idea for solving, create a shuffled shortlink, and a player 1 and player 2 query param.  Player 1 reads from the head, player 2 from the tail...  or just add a server for this stuff
